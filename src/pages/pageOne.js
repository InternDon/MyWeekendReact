With the air, like I don't care, baby by the way. Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof. Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth. Clap along if you know what happiness is to you. Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do.</p>

                    <p>“My mother once said to me; there are two kinds of men you`ll meet. The first will give you the life you want and the second will give you the love you desire. If you`re one of the lucky few, you will find both in the one person. But if you ever find yourself having to choose between the two, then always choose love.” — Lang Leav</p>
